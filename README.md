# GUI
Hey My name is Gulam Rasool
Today is 19th of April and I am going to practice GUI in Python
The Library we are using is #Tkinter to create and Customise Forms 
Following are the Key point and tools We are using: 
    TK() = to create a whole form.
    Frame(form) = to create a separate panel and parameter is the window/form on which frame will created
    pack(side= TOP/BOTTOM/LEFT/RIGHT) = place at specific block of window
    BUTTON(destination,text="..",fg="..",borderwidth=)=to place button on form or frame
    grid(row= , column =) = adjust in table like structure using columns and rows


Description of each code:
1.Double Frame:
                In this we Just create 2 separate Frames.
                3 buttons in one frame(TOP) 
                1 in the Second frame(BOTTOM)
                Adjust the Text on the button
                Did all this using pack() geometry organizer
2.Grid Geometry:
                Adjust Buttons using grid() instead of pack() 
                Create a grid of 25 buttons
                input rows and columns not left or right as in pack()
