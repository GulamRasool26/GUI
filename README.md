    TK() = to create a whole form.
    Frame(form) = to create a separate panel and parameter is the window/form on which frame will created
    pack(side= TOP/BOTTOM/LEFT/RIGHT) = place at specific of window
    BUTTON(destination,text="..",fg="..")=to place button on form or frame

Description of each code:
1.Double Frame:
                In this we Just create 2 separate Frames.
